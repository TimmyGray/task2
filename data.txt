this specification refers to both html and xml attributes and idl attributes often in the same context when it is not clear which is being referred to they are referred to as content attributes for html and xml attributes and idl attributes for those defined on idl interfaces similarly the term properties is used for both javascript object properties and css properties when these are ambiguous they are qualified as object properties and css properties respectively generally when the specification states that a feature applies to the html syntax or the xml syntax it also includes the other when a feature specifically only applies to one of the two languages it is called out by explicitly stating that it does not apply to the other format as in for html this does not apply to xml this specification uses the term document to refer to any use of html ranging from short static documents to long essays or reports with rich multimedia as well as to fully fledged interactive applications the term is used to refer both to document objects and their descendant dom trees and to serialized byte streams using the html syntax or the xml syntax depending on context in the context of the dom structures the terms html document and xml document are used as defined in dom and refer specifically to two different modes that document objects can find themselves in dom such uses are always hyperlinked to their definition in the context of byte streams the term html document refers to resources labeled as text html and the term xml document refers to resources labeled with an xml mime type To run steps in parallel means those steps are to be run one after another at the same time as other logic in the standard e g at the same time as the event loop This standard does not define the precise mechanism by which this is achieved be it time-sharing cooperative multitasking fibers threads processes using different hyperthreads cores CPUs machines etc By contrast an operation that is to run immediately must interrupt the currently running task run itself and then resume the previously running task The specification uses the term supported when referring to whether a user agent has an implementation capable of decoding the semantics of an external resource. A format or type is said to be supported if the implementation can process an external resource of that format or type without critical aspects of the resource being ignored. Whether a specific resource is supported can depend on what features of the resource's format are in use For example a PNG image would be considered to be in a supported format if its pixel data could be decoded and rendered even if unbeknownst to the implementation the image also contained animation data An MPEG-4 video file would not be considered to be in a supported format if the compression format used was not supported even if the implementation could determine the dimensions of the movie from the file's metadata What some specifications in particular the HTTP specifications refer to as a representation is referred to in this specification as a resource TTP A resource's critical subresources are those that the resource needs to have available to be correctly processed Which resources are considered critical or not is defined by the specification that defines the resource's format For CSS style sheets we tentatively define here that their critical subresources are other style sheets imported via import rules including those indirectly imported by other imported style sheets To ease migration from HTML to XML, user agents conforming to this specification will place elements in HTML in the http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml namespace, at least for the purposes of the DOM and CSS. The term "HTML elements" refers to any element in that namespace, even in XML documents Except where otherwise stated all elements defined or mentioned in this specification are in the HTML namespace httз www w3 org html and all attributes defined or mentioned in this specification have no namespace The term element type is used to refer to the set ofelements that have a given local name and namespace For example button elements are elements with the element type button meaning they have the local name button and implicitly as defined above the HTML namespace Attribute names are said to be XML-compatible if they match the Name production defined in XML and they contain no U A COLON characters
